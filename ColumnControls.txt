//forward
This component provides a number of Flow table column formatting tools



Upload the assets
=====================
Upload the js file as an asset in the tenant.
It should be called ColumnControls.js


Add the custom resources the player
====================
<script>
        
var manywho = {
            
	cdnUrl: 'https://assets.manywho.com',
            
	requires: ['core', 'bootstrap3'],
            
           
            
	customResources: [
            
		'https://s3.amazonaws.com/files-manywho-com/<<your tenant id>>/ColumnControls.js',


            ],


In the page designer open the metadata and find the column you want to apply the formatter to and change its "componentType" to one of the following: -

DateTime Columns
================
DateDDMMMYY				This will output the date like "14 May 07"
ElapsedTime				This will show the diference between the date and now and show it as x days, x hours, x minutes, x seconds
ElapsedTimeLiveLong		This will show the diference between the date and now and show it as x days, x hours, x minutes, x seconds and will update this every seconds
ElapsedTimeLiveShort	This will show the diference between the date and now and show it as xd/xh/xm/xs and will update this every seconds
ElapsedTimeFriendly		This will show the diference between the date and now and show it as a friendly string like "a few minutes ago" or "an hour ago"

Boolean Columns
===============
BooleanIcon				This will display a tick for true and a cross for false


Specials
========
LookupValue				This will allow you to look up a value from a page component containing a list specifying the key and value columns and to 
						output the result instead of the key. e.g. the data is a numeric value that equates to a friendly text representation by looking it up in a list.
						for each column using this you need to add attributes to the table  - 3 for each column: -
						LookupListComponent_<typeElementPropertyId of the column>  =  The name of the page component which has the list in it's data source - name not id
						LookupListKeyAttribute_<typeElementPropertyId of the column>  =  The name of the column containing the key lookup field
						LookupListResultAttribute_<typeElementPropertyId of the column>  =  The name of the column containing the value you want to display

						The typeElementPropertyId is found in the metadata editor looking at the specific column of the table
